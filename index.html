<p>
    I'm Antidale. I'm a software developer by trade, someone who enjoys cooking, and someone who's learning to be better
    about cooking. I have a cat, and I volunteer at a no-kill cat shelter in Portland, OR.

    This site is a project I'm working on slowly. Right now, here in the tail end of 2024, I'm working at building out
    the blog portion, and evolving the look and feel of the site. Expect things to change with some frequency, and to
    look kinda bad as I slowly work through more learning of css, and maybe learn something about design. I know I
    expect more of the former, and less of the latter.
