<p>This is a nice recipe for getting your rice cooker to make you breakfast, and makes enough for me to get three breakfasts from it. I often set it up the night before and wake up to hot oatmeal in the winter, and then can decide to reheat the extra portions on subsequent days or just have the leftovers cold. This set assumes you're using a NS-ZCC10 from Zojirushi, check your own cooker's instrucions for porridge/oatmeal style options.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <div class="ingredients-list">
        <ul>
            <li>1 &#x27;cup&#x27; steel-cut oats</li><li>4 &#x27;cups&#x27; water</li><li>2 tbsp chia seeds</li><li>pinch salt</li><li>1 to 2 tbsp dried cherries (or other dried fruit bits)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    

    <h3>Optional Ingredients</h3>
    <div class="ingredients-list">
        <ul>
            <li>splash of almond extract</li><li>pinch of vanilla powder (or splash of vanilla extract)</li><li>up to 1&#x2F;4 C milk-substance (cream, various non-dairy milks, whatever you want, or not)</li><li>1 tbsp peanut butter powder</li><li>1&#x2F;2 to 1 tsp cinnamon or pie spice blend</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
</div><h3 id="directions">Directions</h3>
<p>Take the ingredients in the Base section and put in them in the rice cooker, and stir it about a bit. The "cup" measurement uses the cup provided with the cooker, which is roughly 3/4 C. Set the cooker's mode to Porridge and start it (or set the timer, if setting up overnight).</p>
<p>Once the cooker is done, stop the keep warm setting, and stir the oatmeal to more full mix the water and get a more even consistency. Stir in whatever of the Extras you want. Add in extra liquids a bit at a time until you hit the thickness you're looking for. I don't think I ever hit 1/4 cup of added milk product.</p>
<p>I've also used dried diced apples as the fruit and applesauce as the extra, post-cooking liquid, it was good but maybe a little too sweet for me.</p>
