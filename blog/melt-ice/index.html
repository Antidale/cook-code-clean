<p>The time for this post was before today. Before this year. Before this presidency. Before this decade. Before the last decade. So I'm late with being vocal about it, but I also can't allow myself to being any later than this.</p>
<p>The actions of ICE need to be stopped, and the harms it is causing remedied as best that can be done. The US' entire approach to immigration needs to be recreated. The people, from any party, who have had a hand in creating this agency should never have their hands on any levers of power again. I hope they are haunted by what they've built every time they close their eyes.</p>
<p>Beyond the necessary work of dismantling ICE, all of us who have been complacent but horrified have a duty to our neighbors to work on ourselves to be better citizens, better neighbors, better people. I know I can't help build anything better on the foundations I currently have, and every community I'm a member of can use something better than what we have now.</p>
<p>I'm being a little vague here, because I haven't done the work to be specific, either for what to fix in myself, or what to help build. But I do know that white supremacy is bullshit, that every single part of anti-queer, anti-gay, anti-trans discourse, activity, and legislation is so rancid. That the entire project of the right wing culture war is foul. Toxic to humanity. Reject all of it.</p>
<p>(This is a rough piece, barely edited or thought through.)</p>
