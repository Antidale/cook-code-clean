    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <div class="ingredients-list">
        <ul>
            <li>4-6 garlic cloves, unpeeled</li><li>1 (15 oz) can chickpeas</li><li>1 1&#x2F;4 C broth (I usually use vegetable broth, chicken broth is very good, too)</li><li>1&#x2F;2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    

    <h3>Optional Ingredients</h3>
    <div class="ingredients-list">
        <ul>
            <li>1 Tbsp lemon juice</li><li>1 Tbsp minsed fresh parsley, tarragon, or chives</li><li>Shredded Chicken or Turkey, precooked</li>
        </ul>

<h4 id="garlic-prep">Garlic prep</h4>
<p>Toast the garlic in a medium saucepan over medium heat, moving it around occasionally, until it is fragrant and the skins have begun to brown. Roughly five minutes.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could to some actual roasted garlic, too, but that makes this dish take a lot longer to toss together, and so I don't normally bother.</p>
<p>Either way, once the garlic is appropriately cooked, set it aside to cool enough to handle.</p>
<h4 id="soup-time">Soup Time</h4>
<p>Add the broth and the whole can of chickpeas, including their liquid, to the saucepan and bring to a simmer and reduce to a medium-low heat. When the garlic can be handled well enough, peel it and add it to the saucepan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the chickpeas begin to break down, about 5 to 7 minutes. This is pretty flexible on the timing.</p>
<h4 id="finishing-steps">Finishing steps</h4>
<p>Process the soup in a blender, or use an immersion blender, until smooth.</p>
<p>If you're adding some extra protien, add it now and continue cooking at a low to medium-low temp until it's brought up to temperature. A great way to use up a little leftovers.</p>
<p>Off heat, season with salt, pepper, and paprika. If you're adding some lemon juice or fresh herbs, now's the time for those as well.</p>
<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>
<p>While you can definitely do more with this, I definitely recommend keeping this simple, it's a very nice soup that's easy to throw together.</p>
<p>It's very easy to double (or more) the recipe, and it freezes very well.</p>
