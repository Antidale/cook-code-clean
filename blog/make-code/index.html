<p>One of the things I find to be small hassle in using the dotnet cli for running projects via <code>dotnet run</code> is having to specify the target project as soon as I add some testing projects to the solution. I know I could always <code>cd</code> to the folder of the relevant <code>.csproj</code> file, but that's roughly equal hassle, and I generally prefer to just stay at the root of a project most of the time. I took a little time recently to see if maybe things had changed and you could specify a default project in a <code>.sln</code> or <code>.slnx</code> file, but alas.</p>
<p>However, this <a rel="external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/59942079">stack overflow answer suggesting using a Makefile</a> is a really good solution for me. As a solution, I think it is very customizable, less of a bother than making shell scripts for it, and clear what's going on when you look at it. My favorite little thing is that running <code>make watch-test</code> doesn't actually change the directory of the terminal, so when I stop running tests under the watch, I'm still at the directory root. Delightful!</p>
<p>Here's what I currently have going on in for the one place I'm currently using it (folder names redacted)</p>
<pre><code data-lang="make">watch:
	dotnet watch run --project ./SomeFolder/SomeFolder.csproj
run:
	dotnet run --project ./SomeFolder/SomeFolder.csproj
watch-test:
	cd ./SomeFolder.UnitTests &amp;&amp; dotnet watch test
outdated:
	dotnet outdated -exc FluentAssertions
outdated-upgrade:
	dotnet outdated -exc FluentAssertions -u
</code></pre>
