A recipe very lightly adapted from [Our Balanced Bowl](https://ourbalancedbowl.com/wprm_print/loaded-baked-potato-chowder).

### Ingredients
 * 6 oz pack of bacon (half of a normal 12 oz one, really)
 * 1 large yellow onion, diced
 * 1-2 large clove garlic, minced
 * 1 tbsp all purpose flour
 * 16 oz chicken broth
 * 1.5 to 2 lbs russet potatoes, chopped into bite size pieces
 * 1/4 cup sour cream
 * 1 cup freshly shredded cheddar cheese
 * 3/4 cup heavy cream
 * 1/4 tsp salt (add more if needed!)
 * 1/4 tsp garlic powder
 * 1/4 tsp onion powder
 * 1/4 tsp smoked paprika
 * 1/4 tsp chipotle powder (or other single-chile powder)
 * 1/4 tsp cracked pepper
 * chopped green onions for garnish

### Steps
Begin by prepping the ingredients. 
 * Dice onion into bite size pieces
 * Mince the garlic
 * Wash and chop the potatoes into bite size pieces
 * Dice bacon into bite size pieces.

Add a splash of oil into a large Dutch oven and let it get warm on medium heat. Once the pot is hot, add the bacon and cook until crispy, about 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally to make sure it doesn't burn.

Once the bacon is crispy, remove it onto a paper towel lined plate. I usually take about half of the grease and save it for other uses later. The other half stays in the pot.

To the pot, add in the chopped onion and a pinch of salt. Cook for 3-4 minutes.

Add in the garlic and cook for 1 minute.

Add in the flour and stir until it coats the veggies and cook for 1 minute. Add in the other spices and have it coat the veggies as well.

Add in the chicken broth and whisk to combine, making sure to get all the bits of bacon off the bottom of the pot.

Add in the potatoes. Let boil gently for 10-15 minutes or so until the potatoes are fork tender.

While the potatoes are cooking, you have time to assemble the dairy, so grate the cheese, and measure out your sour cream and heavy cream. Combine the dairy in a bowl to make it easy to do a little tempering.

Once potatoes are fork tender, turn down the heat. Take some of the hot broth and add it to the combined dairy to temper it. Once the dairy's temp has been brough up a bit, mix it into the soup. Add in most of the bacon bits. Heat a little while, but not to boiling.

Serve immediately once soup is warmed in bowls - garnish with green onions, extra bacon bits and extra shredded cheese.
