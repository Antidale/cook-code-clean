### Ingredients
 * 1 Butternut squash
 * Olive oil to lightly coat
 * large pinch salt
 * pepper to taste

### Optional Ingredients
 * large pinch Gochujaru
 * pinch cinnamon
 * zest & juice of 1 lemon
 * pinch paprika (your choice of sweet, hot, or smoked)

### Steps
* Preheat the oven to 450Â°F.
* Peel the squash, cut off top/handle and bottom/root.
* Slice the remaining top section into about 1/2" rounds
* Once you hit the bottom section where the pulp/seeds are, remove them, and then dice this section into about 1/2" cubes
* line a sheet pan with parchment (mostly for helping cleanup)
* place squash on sheet pan, arranging the cubes in the middle and surrounding them with the rounds
* drizzle oil over the squash
* add the large pinch of salt
* grind pepper over the squash
* for any of the optional ingredients, choose one or two and add them on top. (Lemon juice/zest go on at the end, not here)
* thouroughly mix/coat the squash with the oil, salt, pepper, and additional ingredients on both sides
* bake for about 15 minutes
* flip rounds and flip/mix cubes as best you can
* bake for another 15 minutes
* remove from oven, and if you're adding lemon juice/zest, now's the time to add it to the squash.

The rounds are nicely versatile, either making a patty that fits well into an english muffin, a nice side, or can be cut into cubes for a salad. The cubes themselves I normally refrigerate and add to salads over the next couple of days. Adding them to rice or quinoa is also nice.
