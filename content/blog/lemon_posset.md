### Ingredients
1 pint (16 oz) heavy cream
3-4 smallish lemons, zested and juiced
1/2 cup sugar
1/8 tsp vanilla powder (optional)

### Instructions

#### Prep
Zest, then juice the lemons. You're looking for something over 1 tbsp of lemon zest, and between a 1/4 and 1/2 cup of lemon juice.

#### Cooking
1. Combine cream, sugar, and lemon zest in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, cook for 8 to 12 minutes, or until the mixture is reduced to about 2 cups. Stir frequently to fully incorporate the sugar and reduce the chance of things boiling over. Even when you're not stirring, keep an eye on it and be ready to temporarily remove it from the heat to prevent it from boiling over.

2. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the lemon juice. Let cool for about 20 minutes (a skin should form on top). Strain through a fine mesh strainer to separate out the zest. If using the vanilla, now's a great time to add it. Pour strained mixture into whatever serving option you've chosen. Individual ramekins or glasses are common, but I'm often putting it into a 2 cup container of some sort

3. Refrigerate, uncovered, until the posset sets, at least 3 hours. Once chilled, wrap in plastic wrap and they'll keep for a couple/few days. Adding some berries at the end is nice.
