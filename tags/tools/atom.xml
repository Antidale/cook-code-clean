        <content type="html" xml:base="https://antidale.com/blog/make-code/">&lt;p&gt;One of the things I find to be small hassle in using the dotnet cli for running projects via &lt;code&gt;dotnet run&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is having to specify the target project as soon as I add some testing projects to the solution. I know I could always &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to the folder of the relevant &lt;code&gt;.csproj&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file, but that&#x27;s roughly equal hassle, and I generally prefer to just stay at the root of a project most of the time. I took a little time recently to see if maybe things had changed and you could specify a default project in a &lt;code&gt;.sln&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.slnx&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file, but alas.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this &lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;59942079&quot;&gt;stack overflow answer suggesting using a Makefile&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a really good solution for me. As a solution, I think it is very customizable, less of a bother than making shell scripts for it, and clear what&#x27;s going on when you look at it. My favorite little thing is that running &lt;code&gt;make watch-test&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; doesn&#x27;t actually change the directory of the terminal, so when I stop running tests under the watch, I&#x27;m still at the directory root. Delightful!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s what I currently have going on in for the one place I&#x27;m currently using it (folder names redacted)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;watch:
	dotnet watch run --project .&#x2F;SomeFolder&#x2F;SomeFolder.csproj
run:
	dotnet run --project .&#x2F;SomeFolder&#x2F;SomeFolder.csproj
watch-test:
	cd .&#x2F;SomeFolder.UnitTests &amp;amp;&amp;amp; dotnet watch test
outdated:
	dotnet outdated -exc FluentAssertions
outdated-upgrade:
	dotnet outdated -exc FluentAssertions -u
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lightbulb has been blown for at least four years. I don&#x27;t actually remember how long it&#x27;s been since I had a light in the oven, but I know it was pre-Pandemic. I replaced it today, and now I don&#x27;t have to open the oven door to see if the bread is browning, or if some veggies are picking up some color as they roast. A small annoyance is now a lesson, if I remember it that way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a little while, I&#x27;d noticed that one point on my oven&#x27;s heating element was brighter than the rest of it, pretty much all the time it was on. A few days ago, I was preheating the oven to bake some cookies, and took a look inside the oven and saw that the previously brighter part of the heating element was now VERY bright, possibly on fire. I turned the oven off, kept the door open to let things cool down faster, and watched as things came back to a state of Not On Fire.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the replacement element came. With the help of &lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nBu5k8ZhOoY&quot;&gt;a nice video&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; demonstrating the repair process, I manged to replace the element, even through a bit of panic when one of the connector clips had almost no extra reach, and also disappeared into the back of the oven. The cat gave some questionable supervisory help, but I&#x27;m now enjoying some of the cookies I&#x27;d intended to make last week.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
