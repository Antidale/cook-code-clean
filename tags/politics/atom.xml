        <content type="html" xml:base="https://antidale.com/blog/melt-ice/">&lt;p&gt;The time for this post was before today. Before this year. Before this presidency. Before this decade. Before the last decade. So I&#x27;m late with being vocal about it, but I also can&#x27;t allow myself to being any later than this.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actions of ICE need to be stopped, and the harms it is causing remedied as best that can be done. The US&#x27; entire approach to immigration needs to be recreated. The people, from any party, who have had a hand in creating this agency should never have their hands on any levers of power again. I hope they are haunted by what they&#x27;ve built every time they close their eyes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the necessary work of dismantling ICE, all of us who have been complacent but horrified have a duty to our neighbors to work on ourselves to be better citizens, better neighbors, better people. I know I can&#x27;t help build anything better on the foundations I currently have, and every community I&#x27;m a member of can use something better than what we have now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m being a little vague here, because I haven&#x27;t done the work to be specific, either for what to fix in myself, or what to help build. But I do know that white supremacy is bullshit, that every single part of anti-queer, anti-gay, anti-trans discourse, activity, and legislation is so rancid. That the entire project of the right wing culture war is foul. Toxic to humanity. Reject all of it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This is a rough piece, barely edited or thought through.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
